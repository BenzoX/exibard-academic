title: MoVeMnt - Mode(l)s of Verification and Monitorability
summary: The project lies in the area of runtime verification and, as the name suggests, aims at studying monitorability of properties, i.e. whether there exists a program (called a monitor) that checks whether a given property holds by examining the execution of the system under scrutiny *at runtime*.

In 2021 and 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the *Icelandic Centre of Excellence in Theoretical Computer Science* [(ICE-TCS)](http://www.icetcs.ru.is/)  at [Reykjavik University](https://en.ru.is/), in the *Mode(l)s of Verification and Monitorability* [(MoVeMnt)](https://sites.google.com/view/antonisachilleos/movemnt) project, with [Luca Aceto](https://www.ru.is/faculty/luca/), [Antonis Achilleos](https://sites.google.com/view/antonisachilleos/), [Anna Ing&oacute;lfsd&oacute;ttir](https://www.ru.is/kennarar/annai/), [Adrian Francalanza](https://staff.um.edu.mt/afra1/) and [Karoliina Lehtinen](http://www.pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~karoliina.lehtinen/).
The project lies in the area of runtime verification and, as the name suggests, aims at studying monitorability of properties, i.e. whether there exists a program (called a monitor) that checks whether a given property holds by examining the execution of the system under scrutiny *at runtime*. I maintain a collaboration with this group.
